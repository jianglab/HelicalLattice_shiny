# HelicalLattice: 2D lattice â‡” helical lattice
**HelicalLattice** is a Web app that helps the user to understand how a helical lattice and its underlying 2D lattice can interconvert. The user can specify any 2D lattice and choose a line segment connecting any pair of lattice points that defines the block of 2D lattice to be rolled up into a helical lattice.
